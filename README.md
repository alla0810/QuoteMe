# QuoteMe

## Description

QuoteMe is a web application designed to enhance emotional well-being through personalized affirmations, shared mindfulness experiences, and private journaling. Our motivation was to create a platform that fosters a supportive community for individuals to reflect on their feelings, find motivation, and connect with others on a similar journey.

- **What problem does it solve?** QuoteMe offers a space for self-reflection and personal growth by providing users with affirmations based on their current emotions and a bulletin board to share and read inspirational stories.
- **What did we learn?** This project was an exploration into building full-stack applications using MERN stack, emphasizing React for frontend development and GraphQL for efficient data handling.
